# Got 2048?

Small goal, long way. (Yet another) Android port of the entertaining web game 2048.

## origin / credit

To my knowledge [this website](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) by [Gabriele Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.com/) is the original version of the game **2048** but he also mentions further inspirations on his website.

## Goal

Swipe UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT to move all tiles on the grid in this direction. Tiles with the same value will be merged into one. The goal is to get a tile with the value 2048.
